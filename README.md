## QA Automation Practice – AutomationExercise (Playwright)

### General Information
This project contains my first automated tests written in Playwright.
It was created as a learning project to practice UI test automation and apply good QA automation practices.

The tests are written in Playwright + TypeScript, and the project is based on the Page Object Model (POM) architecture, which helps with:

* cleaner and more readable tests
* easier maintenance
* scalable and extensible test structure

The tests are executed on the practice website AutomationExercise:

### 🎯 Project Goal

The main goals of this project are:

* learning Playwright from scratch
* practicing end-to-end test automation
* testing common user flows (registration, login, products, cart, etc.)
* applying a proper test architecture (POM)
